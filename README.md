## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learnt how to Structure a project, How to do a research before starting a project.

In the process of trying to implement CSS grid, I improved my knowledge of CSS grid and Css in general.

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more. -->

### Useful resources

- [Andrew Bergeron's codepen](https://codepen.io/visualrhythm/pen/OqWozw) - This helped me understand CSS grid
- [Example resource 2](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#:~:text=CSS%20Grid%20Layout%20aka%20%E2%80%9CGrid,very%20good%20job%20of%20it.) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
